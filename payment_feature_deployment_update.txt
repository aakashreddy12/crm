# Payment Feature Deployment Update

## 1. New Features Added

1. Payment receipts now correctly use the selected payment mode
2. Added ability for admin@axisogreen.in to delete payments
3. Advance payment now shows the project's payment mode in the history table

## 2. Database Update
No additional database changes required beyond the previous update:

```sql
-- Add payment_mode and payment_date columns to the payment_history table
ALTER TABLE payment_history ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_mode TEXT CHECK (payment_mode IN ('Cash', 'UPI', 'Loan')) DEFAULT 'Cash';
ALTER TABLE payment_history ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS payment_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE;
```

## 3. Build and Deploy

### Build the project
```
cd /path/to/updatedcrm
npm run build
```

### Deploy to crm folder
```
rm -r crm/build
cp -r build crm/
cd crm
```

### Create a zip file (PowerShell)
```
Compress-Archive -Path build -DestinationPath build.zip -Force
```

### Git commands to commit and push
```
git add build build.zip payment_feature_deployment_update.txt
git commit -m "Add payment deletion and fix receipt payment mode"
git push origin main
```

## 4. Security Notes

- Only admin@axisogreen.in can delete payments
- When payments are deleted:
  - The payment record is removed from the payment_history table
  - The project's paid_amount is automatically updated
  - A confirmation prompt is shown before deletion to prevent accidental removal
