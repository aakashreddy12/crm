# Payment System Fixes

This update includes two critical fixes for the payment system:

## 1. Fix for Deleted Payments Reappearing After Page Refresh

### Issue:
- Deleted payments were reappearing in the payment history after the page was refreshed.

### Solution:
- Modified the `handleDeletePayment` function to properly fetch fresh data from the database after a payment is deleted.
- Ensured proper database updates by implementing a three-step process: 
  1. Get payment amount
  2. Delete payment record
  3. Update project's paid amount
  4. Fetch the latest data instead of relying on local state

### Affected Files:
- src/components/ProjectDetails.tsx

## 2. Incorrect Timestamp Display

### Issue:
- Timestamps for payments were displaying incorrectly.
- Time elapsed calculations were not properly accounting for timezone differences.

### Solution:
- Updated the `getTimeElapsed` function to correctly handle timezone offsets.
- Modified the payment history table to use payment_date instead of created_at for time elapsed calculations.
- Improved timestamp display logic with better fallbacks and proper handling of edge cases.
- Added "Just now" display for very recent payments (less than a minute ago).

### Affected Files:
- src/components/ProjectDetails.tsx

## 3. Payment Processing Improvements

### Additional Improvements:
- Enhanced the `handlePayment` function to update the database directly and then fetch fresh data, rather than updating local state.
- Ensured consistent user experience by preserving payment date and mode inputs between payments.
- Improved payment receipt generation by properly passing the payment mode.

### Deployment:
- These changes have been deployed to the production environment on [date].
