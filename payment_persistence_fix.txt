# Payment Persistence Fix

## Issue
Deleted payments were reappearing in the system after page refresh or other actions. This issue was persistent despite previous attempts to correct it through standard deletion methods.

## Root Cause Analysis
The problem appears to be related to:
1. Supabase's trigger mechanism that automatically updates project paid amounts
2. Possible caching issues in the frontend application
3. Incomplete deletion processing in the database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Frontend Deletion Logic
- Modified the `handleDeletePayment` function in `ProjectDetails.tsx` to:
  - Use more specific deletion criteria with `.match()` instead of `.eq()`
  - Add loading state management during deletion for better UX
  - Attempt to call an RPC function for guaranteed deletion

### 2. Database-Level Fix
Created a new SQL function `ensure_payment_deleted` that:
- Temporarily disables all triggers on the payment_history table
- Forcibly deletes the payment record by ID
- Manually recalculates and updates the project's paid_amount
- Re-enables triggers after completion

This approach guarantees that the payment is completely removed from the database and that the project's paid amount is correctly recalculated, regardless of any automatic database processes that might be interfering.

### 3. Deployment Steps
1. Execute the SQL function in Supabase SQL Editor
2. Deploy the updated frontend code
3. Test deletion functionality on various projects

## Future Considerations
- Monitor the system for any recurrence of the issue
- Consider implementing soft delete for payments instead of hard delete if audit trail is required
- Add explicit sync mechanisms between frontend and backend data for critical operations
