# Payment Receipt Fix

## Issue Fixed
Fixed the payment receipt to correctly display the selected payment mode rather than showing a hardcoded "Cash/UPI" text.

## Solution
Updated `PaymentReceipt.tsx` to use the `paymentMode` prop that's passed from the parent component instead of a hardcoded value.

## Files Changed
- `src/components/PaymentReceipt.tsx`: Changed hardcoded "Cash/UPI" to use the `paymentMode` prop

## Important Notes
1. The payment receipt now correctly shows whatever payment mode is selected when adding a payment (Cash, UPI, or Loan)
2. The advance payment is still displayed as "Advance Payment" in the payment history table
3. The delete payment functionality remains available only to admin@axisogreen.in

## Deployment Steps Taken
1. Fixed the code in PaymentReceipt.tsx
2. Built the project with `npm run build`
3. Copied the new build to crm folder
4. Created a new build.zip file
5. Added, committed, and pushed changes to the repository
